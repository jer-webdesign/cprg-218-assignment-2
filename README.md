Assignment: JavaScript Timeline
Objective
Using JavaScript to enhance the user experience of a website is a valuable skill for a web developer. Building your first webpage using JavaScript for interactivity lets you practice skills learned in class.

Instructions
Create a single HTML 5 page that provides information about a topic of your choosing as a timeline. The page should feature at least four clearly labelled button elements arranged in a line - either a row or column. One button should allow the user to see an introduction to the topic, and each of the other three to see information about a period on your timeline.

When the user clicks a button, an information box containing at least one paragraph and one media element (photo, video or audio) about the chosen period of time from your timeline should appear above, below or beside the buttons. The informational boxes should be modal: that is, they should only appear one at a time, and the page should never have more than one information box visible at any moment in time.

All text content should be written and produced by the student. Where possible images and other media elements should also be created by the student - and if not, should follow proper license terms.

Use CSS to customize the appearance of the page and informational boxes. Use your design knowledge to create a design that helps to tell the story of and enhance the content of the website. The page must be responsive while following the rules of good design in respect to visual appearance and UI. Your CSS should be in a linked style sheet and should display well at any viewport width between 320 and 3200 pixels.
